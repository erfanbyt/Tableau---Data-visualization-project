# Data visualization project with Tableau

I developed this personal project to learn Tableau in detail. 

Great thanks to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S5vkJVuaHc) YouTube channel for this step by step project.

## Data source
The data includes the loan information for more than 13,000 people from the US. The data source provides 26 categories of information, including

* loan data
* amount
* received amount
* employment length
* interest rate
* and many more

## Goal
The goal of the project is to develop an interactive dashboard that Exports, transforms, and Loads (ETL) the data in Tableau for visualizing informative information, like

* good loans VS bad loans
* Loan distribution in the US
* and some other important metrics related to the total fund and amount received categorized by purpose, location/, employment length, etc.


The repository includes all the source data, SQL commands used to extract the data, and the [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_17394182905110/OVERVIEW?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to the Tableau project.
